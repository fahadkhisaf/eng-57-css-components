### Components library
This repo is an intro into components and how to build a library.

### What are components
 - Building blocks for front-end
 - Can be used to build almost any website

 # Examples
 - Buttons
 - Avatars
 - Banners
 - Cards
 - Forms
 - Containers
 - Footers
 - Navbars

### Flexbox
- Used to put items next to each other, instead of in a block
- Aligns items easily
- Tells object to grow and have a minimum size
- flex: 1200 px
- if things are not alligned try killing margins


```
      display: flex;
      align-items: center;
      justify-content: space-around OR space-between
```
